# ChaRUSTer

A simple Rust application for generating characters from dictionaries.

## Instructions

To start the generation simply execute the `main` function in the `src/main.rs` file.

### Configuration

In the `resources/config.toml` file you can find some options to tweak.

In the `execution_conf` section you can set how many characters to generate and some other props.

In the `char_conf` section you can enable or disable particular properties to add to the characters to generate.

In the `values_conf` section you can specify some data and the dictionaries to use to generate the characters. Currently the default dictionaries are already set.
